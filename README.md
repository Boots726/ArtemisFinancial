Artemis Financial

- Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

  Artemis Financial develops individualized financial plans for their customers. The financial plans include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. They want to modernize their operations, providing secure communications via their web application. They requested that we make the web application as secure as possible. 
  
- What did you do very well when you found your client's software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company's overall wellbeing?

Documentation. I believe that I documented the vulnerabilities well. 
It is important to code securely to disallow unauthorized access to the clients information, and to protect our web application from attackers. By coding securely we are able to build and maintain a trust with our customer base, increasing revenue than if we did not code securely and lost customers to other companies that do code securely.
  
- What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

Initially, I found it difficult to create the dependancy check, but after performing it a few times, I felt that I became more proficient with it. 
  
- How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

By creating a certificate required to access the application, and performing a dependency check along with removal of dependencies created a secure web application that Artemis Financial can utilize to broaden its customer base. 
  
- How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

Using the Vulnerability Assessment Process Flow Diagram, I evaluated the areas where security should be improved, and worked to improve those areas. I perfromed multiple runs of the program to verify functionality. I ran dependency checks, removed dependencies, and re-ran the checks. 
  
- What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I used the Java Keytool plugin, and Maven dependency checks. I believe these will both come in use in the future.
  
- Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would show future employers the HTML dependency checks, and describe the process to perform the dependency checks, and methids utilized to remove those dependencies.
